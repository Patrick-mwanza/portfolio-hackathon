    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <pre>
My educational journey revolves around IT, where I’m constantly learning, exploring, 
and keeping up with the latest innovations. Whether it's coding, networking, or diving into
new tech trends, IT is more than just a field for me—it's a passion.
Beyond tech, I’m into table tennis, a game that sharpens my reflexes and keeps me active. 
I also love reading novels, getting lost in different stories and perspectives. 
Whether it’s an intense match or an immersive book, I enjoy the mix of challenge and
creativity in everything I do.
Always eager to grow, learn, and push boundaries—both in IT and life.
